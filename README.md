## XMRig without donations
Although it may seem evil to not help the original project, it is impossible to disable the donate option, which has a minimum of 1% and a default of 5%! That is way too high. It is very simple to disable the donate option once you have the source code, but especially on Windows, its hard to compile.
If you can, please donate to the developers of XMRig before using this at:

This repo is a fork of the original, but just with no forced donate, and precompiled.
